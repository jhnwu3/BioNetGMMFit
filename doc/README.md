# **Snapshot**
Snapshot is a C++ software designed for rate constant estimation of CYTOF Snapshot Data. 
It takes into account both linear and nonlinear models of evolution for estimating rate constants.

## **3rd Party Libraries**

### *Compatibility*
All software currently has only been tested on Linux-based systems.

### *Eigen*
Snapshot uses the Eigen 3.3.9 linear algebra library for matrix computations.

### *Boost*
Snapshot uses the Boost 1.7.2 mathematics C++ library for ODE estimations for nonlinear systems.
